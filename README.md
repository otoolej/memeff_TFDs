# Fast and Memory-Efficient Algorithms for Quadratic Time–Frequency Distributions

A collection of M-files to compute time–frequency distributions from the quadratic class [[1]](#references). Memory and computational load is limited by controlling the level of over-sampling for the TFD. Oversampling in the TFD is proportional to signal length and bandwidth of the Doppler–lag kernel. Algorithms are optimised to four kernel types: nonseparable, separable, lag-independent, and Doppler-independent kernels.  

Also included are algorithms to compute decimated, or sub-sampled, TFDs. Again, these
algorithms are specific to the four kernel types but compute approximate TFDs by a process
of decimatation.  

Requires Matlab or Octave (programming environments).

# quick start
First, add paths using the `load_curdir` function:
```matlab
  >> load_curdir;
```

# description

There are two sets of TFD algorithms: one set computes oversampled TFDs and the other
set computes decimated (sub-sampled or undersampled) TFDs. The first set, for computing
oversampled TFDs, has four algorithms for specific kernel types, namely the
- non-separable kernel,
- separable kernel,
- Doppler-independent (DI) kernel,
- and lag-independent (LI) kernel.

The function to generate these oversampled TFDs is `full_tfd.m`. The following
examples, using a test signal, illustrates usage:

```matlab
  % generate test signal:
  N=512;
  x=gen_LFM(N,0.1,0.3) + gen_LFM(N,0.4,0.04);

  % nonseparable kernel (Choi-Williams kernel):
  tf=full_tfd(x,'nonsep',{'cw',10});
  figure(1); clf; vtfd(tf,x);
  
  % separable kernel:
  tf=full_tfd(x,'sep',{{51,'hann'},{101,'hann'}},256,256);
  figure(2); clf; vtfd(tf,x);
  
  % Doppler-independent kernel:
  tf=full_tfd(x,'DI',{101,'hann'},[],256);
  figure(3); clf; vtfd(tf,x);
  
  % lag-independent kernel:
  tf=full_tfd(x,'LI',{51,'hann'},256,[]);
  figure(4); clf; vtfd(tf,x);
```

Type `help full_tfd` for more details.

Likewise, the algorithms for decimated TFDs are specific to the four kernel types. The
function `dec_tfd` computes the decimated TFDs, as the following examples show:

```matlab
  N=1024; Ntime=64; Nfreq=128;                                              
  a=2; b=2;                                                       
  ni=[100:2:900]; ki=[150:2:850];                                 
                                                                  
  x=gen_LFM(N,0.1,0.3)+gen_LFM(N,0.4,0.1);                        
                                                                  
  % non-separable kernel:                                         
  c=dec_tfd(x,'nonsep',{'cw',100},N,N,a*4,b*4);                       
  figure(1); clf; vtfd(c,x);                                      
                                                                  
  % separable kernel:                                             
  c=dec_tfd(x,'sep',{{51,'hann'},{101,'hann'}},Ntime,Nfreq,a,b);    
  figure(2); clf; vtfd(c,x);                                      
                                                                  
  % Doppler-independent kernel:                                   
  c=dec_tfd(x,'DI',{101,'hann'},N,Nfreq,ni,b);                      
  figure(3); clf; vtfd(c,x,1,ni);                                 
                                                                  
  % lag-independent kernel:                                       
  c=dec_tfd(x,'LI',{51,'hann'},Ntime,N,a,ki);                       
  figure(4); clf; vtfd(c,x,1,[],ki./(N*2));                       
```

# computational load

The computational load is measured in terms of the number of FFTs required to compute the
TFD. Memory load is measured as the total memory required to compute and store the
TFD. The real-valued signal (i.e. input signal) is of length N.

Computational load for the oversampled TFDs (using `full_tfd.m`) is as follows for the
four kernel types:

| kernel-type   | computational load           | memory (real-valued points) |
|---------------|------------------------------|-----------------------------|
| non-separable | 3N²/2 log₂ N                 | N²                          |
| LI            | NNtime/2 log₂ Ntime          | Ntime × N                   |
| DI            | NNfreq/2 log₂ Nfreq          | N × Nfreq                   |
| separable     | Pₕ(N log₂N +Ntime log₂Ntime) | Ntime × Nfreq               |
|               | + NtimeNfreq/2 log₂ Nfreq    |                             |

assuming the FFT of length-N signal requires Nlog₂N computations and using the notation:

| symbol | explanation                                                 |
|--------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| N      | length of signal                                            |
| Ntime  | length of TFD in time direction                             |
| Nfreq  | length of TFD in frequency direction                        |
| Pₕ     | Pₕ = P/2, where P is the length of the lag window           |

And for the decimated TFDs (using `dec_tfd.m`):

| kernel-type   | computational load           | memory (real-valued points) | grid     |
|---------------|------------------------------|-----------------------------|----------|
| non-separable | N²/2 log₂ N + LJ/2 log₂ J    | L × J                       | ρ[an,bn] |
| LI            | VLtime/2 log₂ Ltime          | Ltime × V                   | ρ[an,kᵢ] |
| DI            | UJfreq/2 log₂ Jfreq          | U × Jfreq                   | ρ[nᵢ,bk] |
| separable     | JfreqN/2 log₂N               | Ltime × Jfreq               | ρ[an,bn] |
|               | + LtimeJfreq log₂ LtimeJfreq |                             |          |
   
using the extra notation:

| symbol | explanation                                                 |
|--------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| U      | length of sequence nᵢ {nᵢ for 1<=i<=U}, U<=N and 0<=nᵢ<=N-1   |
| V      | length of sequence kᵢ {kᵢ for 1<=i<=V}, V<=N and 0<=kᵢ<=N-1   |
| J      | N/b, b is decimation integer in frequency direction         |
| L      | N/a, a is decimation integer in time direction              |
| Jfreq  | Nfreq/b, b is decimation integer in frequency direction     |
| Ltime  | Ntime/a, a is decimation integer in time direction          |
